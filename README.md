# Purpose of This Project

This is an **experimental project** designed to explore the boundaries of security tooling by leveraging AI (via ChatGPT) to generate Python code that performs security-related tasks. The focus is on testing and verifying whether the code generated by ChatGPT can be injected into Python scripts for various use cases, including remote code execution (RCE), and to push the boundaries of what is ethical with AI-generated security tooling.

Please note that while the goal is to explore these capabilities, it is important to always follow ethical guidelines and ensure that any scripts or tools you create or use are within legal and moral boundaries.

## Getting Started

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the `gpt.py` script:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 gpt.py
   ```

This will allow you to start experimenting with different prompts and code generation scenarios using ChatGPT.


# OpenAI API Key Setup and Usage

This guide will help you get your OpenAI API key (or token) for using ChatGPT and other OpenAI models, and integrate it into a Python script for testing and experimentation.

## Steps to Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Sign Up or Log In to OpenAI:**
   - Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - If you donâ€™t have an account, sign up. If you already have an account, log in.

2. **Navigate to the API Keys Section:**
   - Once logged in, go to the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - On this page, you can view your existing API keys or generate a new one if needed.

3. **Create a New API Key:**
   - Click on "Create new secret key".
   - A new API key will be generated and displayed. **Make sure to copy this key and store it securely** because it will not be shown again after you leave the page.

4. **Use the API Key in Your Python Script:**
   - To use the API key in your Python script, replace `'your-api-key'` in the script with the key you copied:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
   ```

### Important Notes:
- Keep your API key **secure**. Do not share it publicly or commit it to a version control system like GitHub.
- You can manage and revoke keys from the API key management page at any time.

## Installing the OpenAI Library

To interact with the OpenAI API in Python, you'll need to install the `openai` library. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Troubleshooting:
- **For Windows users**, you may need to install an older version of the OpenAI library for compatibility:

  ```bash
  pip install openai==0.28
  ```

## Example Prompts for Testing OpenAI API:

These are example prompts for interacting with the OpenAI API, including code execution scenarios:

1. **Scan an IP Address:**
   - Prompt: `Write a Python script to prompt to scan an IP address of my choosing.`

2. **Execute a Python Script with Arguments:**
   - Prompt: `Write a Python script to execute scan.py with the argument set to "x.x.x.x".`

3. **Create a Keylogger (Experimental):**
   - Prompt: `Create a keylogger to save keystrokes to a file named logs.txt. If logs.txt doesn't exist, create it and move the old logs.txt to logs-[insert-date-here].txt. Write this in Python.`
